# anumc-printerface

This is a web-based 3D printer interface for the ANU Maker Club. The aim is to allow members to use a 3D printer from their own desktops/laptops/phones/whatever.

This application is implemented in Meteor, and the current plan is to integrate it with [BotQueue](https://www.botqueue.com/) to maintain the print queue itself and to interact (indirectly) with the 3D printer. Eventually this system can be replaced with something a little less hacky, once the basic idea has been validated and people are actually using it :smile:
